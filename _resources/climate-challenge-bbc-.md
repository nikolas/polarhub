This is a game available for free dowload.  Players must respond to catastrophic events caused by climate change as well as natural and manmade events, which may or may not be linked to climate change. This aspect of the game is meant to give some idea of what could happen as the Earth's climate changes and also introduce the unpredictable nature of some natural events.  This is a single player strategy game  where you are president of the European Nations & must tackle climate change and stay popular enough to remain in office.(2006)
