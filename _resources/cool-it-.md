This card game from the Union of Concerned Scientists enables teachers and parents to talk about global warming in a fun and hopeful way. Kids, meanwhile, will learn that all of us make choices that determine whether the world warms a little or a lot, and which of those choices reduce global warming emissions. The game costs $7.95.  A teachers guide is available via free download. (2010)
