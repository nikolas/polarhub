# What is The PoLAR Hub?
The PoLAR Hub is the official website of the Polar Learning and
Responding (PoLAR) Climate Change Education Partnership.  In addition
to featuring the latest in polar climate science, news, and research,
the Hub provides information on educational resources focused on polar
climate change, including the games, activities, and other innovative
tools developed by the PoLAR Partnership.
