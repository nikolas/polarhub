**Lisa Zaval**, Post-Doc

PoLAR Project: Greenify

Lisa Zaval is a postdoctoral research scientist at the Center for Research on Environmental Decisions. Lisa’s research focuses on judgment and decision-making, with a particular emphasis on individual differences, risk perception, emotional processing and the effect of aging on decision-making capacity and consumer behavior. Her work in the CRED lab investigates choice architecture related to sustainability and pro-environmental decision making, investigating how features of the decision context can influence different attitudes and behaviors (e.g., green product choice, charitable giving). A related line of work investigates the underlying psychological drivers that influence these climate change judgments.
